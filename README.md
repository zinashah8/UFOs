# UFOs

## Overview

Using a dataset related to UFO sightings, I created a webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings. 

Users will be able to filter through a table containing UFO sightings information based on multiple criterion such as the city, state, country, event date, and shape. 

## Resources
- Data Source: [UFO data](https://github.com/zinashah8/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
- Technologies Used: 
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - VS Code
    - BootStrap

## Summary
- Drawbacks of the Design: Hard to distinguish which factors can be input. Ex: when picking a city to filter by, user would have to go through the table a find the city of interest.
- This could be solved by including drop down menus of cities available. 
- Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
- Would also need a button to clear all filters and to refresh and see which filters were selected after filering has been completed.
